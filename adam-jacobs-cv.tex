\section{\mysidestyle Profile}\vspace{1mm}
Using optimism and curiosity to lead technological innovation. I use my experience in leading digitalization projects and hands-on knowledge of applying technology as a toolbox. Realizing amzing tech as viable business to customers make my clock tick. Currently a board member of THS (Student Union at KTH), which involves making changes and decisions that affects many students.

\section{\mysidestyle Core Values}\vspace{1mm}
    \textbf{Listen}! There's always someone that knows more than you on a specific subject. Effective leadership is complementing your own skills
    \\
     \textbf{Performance!} It is achieved via effort and not how smart you are. There are no limits. If you don't know enough, then learn!
    \\
    \textbf{Courage!} Making tough decisions, standing out and being innovative takes courage. I like to spread it to others since it will then spread back to you in other ways.

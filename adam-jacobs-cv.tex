\section{\mysidestyle Profile}\vspace{1mm}
I enjoy taking the lead for technological innovation that empowers people. I use my experience in leading digitalization in education and interest in programming and science as a toolbox. My vision is to make sure that as many people as possible can be part of how Artificial Intelligence and modern computing exponentially improves our world.
